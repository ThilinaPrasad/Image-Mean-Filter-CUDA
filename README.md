# Image-Mean-Filter-CUDA
Mean filter is a simple method used in image processing to reduce noise in images. This is an simple approch to create this mean filter approach with cuda language. This is tested on Gforce GTX 480 VGA. 

> This simple codes are executed to test the performance diffrences
> between CPU and GPU.
